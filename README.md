## This is my password strength meter project.

1. Password Strength Criteria

A strong password should:
✅ Be at least 8 characters long
✅ Contain uppercase & lowercase letters
✅ Include at least one digit (0-9)
✅ Have one special character (!@#$%^&*)

2. Scoring System

Weak (Score: 1-2) → Short, missing key elements
Moderate (Score: 3-4) → Good but missing some security features
Strong (Score: 5) → Meets all criteria

3. Feedback System

If the password is weak, suggest improvements.
If the password is strong, display a success message.
